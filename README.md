## Me, playing around with Scala 3

I'm trying to use as many fancy keywords that I can. Here it is what I've gotten so far:

A purely functional asynchronous streamed real time websocket communication discord bot using scala 3, cats and fs2.

### Usage

At project root, run:
``` sh
sbt runWithProxy
```

It needs docker installed and port 8020 opened.
